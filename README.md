# HTML and CSS Projects

Here are some of the projects I completed over the course of **[The Tech Academy's](https://www.learncodinganywhere.com)** HTML and CSS Course.

## Projects

**[One-Page Website Assignment](https://github.com/taylor-peters/HTML-and-CSS-Projects/tree/main/One-Page%20Website)**
<br>Using my new knowledge of HTML and basic CSS, I constructed a simple One-Page-Website with a National Park theme.

**[Implementing New Concepts](https://github.com/taylor-peters/HTML-and-CSS-Projects/tree/main/One-Page%20Website)**
<br>With increased confidence and understanding, I was able to take the previous assignment code and modify further.

**[Final Assignment](https://github.com/taylor-peters/taylor-peters.github.io)**
<br>For the final assignment of the HTML and CSS course, I created a Portfolio website.
